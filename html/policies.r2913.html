<a name="Preamble"></a>
<a name="Preamble-1"></a>
<h2 class="unnumbered">Preamble</h2>

<p>This document describes the policies in place for the
<a href="http://www.R-project.org/">R</a> package repository hosted by the
<a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/">Comprehensive R Archive Network</a>.  In
what follows, this <a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/web/packages/">CRAN
package repository</a> will be referred to as &ldquo;CRAN&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>CRAN is maintained by the efforts of volunteers (the &ldquo;CRAN team&rdquo;) and
the resources of the <a href="http://www.R-project.org/foundation/main.html">R Foundation</a> and the employers of those volunteers
(WU Wien, TU Dortmund, U Oxford, AT&amp;T Research).  Having a package
distributed by CRAN is subject to a set of policies, and submitting a
package (including an update) to CRAN indicates agreement to these
policies.
</p>
<p>Distributing code or documentation is subject to legal requirements,
and CRAN operates in many jurisdictions.  One of the aims of these
policies is to ensure that the distributors meet their legal
obligations of diligence without excessive work.
</p>
<p>The time of the volunteers is CRAN&rsquo;s most precious resource, and they
reserve the right to remove or modify packages on CRAN without notice
or explanation (although notification will usually be given).
</p>
<hr>
<a name="Source-packages"></a>
<a name="Source-packages-1"></a>
<h2 class="unnumbered">Source packages</h2>

<ul>
<li> The ownership of copyright and intellectual property rights of all
components of the package must be clear and unambiguous (including from
the authors specification in the <samp>DESCRIPTION</samp> file).  Where code
is copied (or derived) from the work of others (including from R
itself), care must be taken that any copyright/license statements are
preserved and authorship is not misrepresented.

<p>Where copyrights are held by an entity other than the authors, the
<code>Authors@R</code> field can be used, or a <code>Copyright</code> field (if
necessary referring to an <samp>inst/COPYRIGHTS</samp> file).
</p>
<p>Trademarks must be respected.
</p>
</li><li> The package&rsquo;s <samp>DESCRIPTION</samp> file must show both the name and email
address of a single designated maintainer (not a mailing list).  That
contact address must be kept up to date, and be usable for information
mailed by the CRAN team without any form of filtering, confirmation
&hellip;

<p>The maintainer warrants that (s)he is acting on behalf of all credited
authors and has their agreement to use their material in the way it is
included in the package (or if this is not possible, warrants that it is
used in accordance with the license granted by the original author).
</p>
<p>Additional <samp>DESCRIPTION</samp> fields could be used for providing email
addresses for contacting the package authors/developers (e.g.,
&lsquo;<samp>Contact</samp>&rsquo;), or a URL for submitting bug reports (e.g.,
&lsquo;<samp>BugReports</samp>&rsquo;).
</p>
</li><li> Source packages may not contain any form of binary executable code.

</li><li> Source packages under an Open Source license must provide source or
something which can easily be converted back to source (e.g.,
<samp>.rda</samp> files) for all components of the package (including for
example PDF documentation and configure files produced by
<code>autoconf</code>).

<p>Such packages are not permitted to require (e.g., by specifying in
&lsquo;<samp>Depends</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>Imports</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>LinkingTo</samp>&rsquo; fields) directly or
indirectly a package or external software which restricts users or
usage.
</p>
<p>The package&rsquo;s license must give the right for CRAN to distribute the
package in perpetuity.  Any change to a package&rsquo;s license must be
highlighted when an update is submitted (for there have been instances
of an undocumented license change removing even the right of CRAN to
distribute the package).
</p>
</li><li> Package authors should make all reasonable efforts to provide
cross-platform portable code.  Packages will not normally be accepted
that do not run on at least two of the major R platforms.  Cases for
Windows-only packages will be considered, but CRAN may not be the most
appropriate place to host them.

</li><li> Packages should be named in a way that does not conflict (irrespective
of case) with any current or past CRAN package (the Archive area can be
consulted), nor any current <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a> package.  Package maintainers give the right to use that
package name to CRAN when they submit, so the CRAN team may orphan a
package and allow another maintainer to take it over.

<p>When a new maintainer wishes to take over a package, this should be
accompanied by the written agreement of the previous maintainer
(unless the package has been formally orphaned).
</p>
</li><li> Packages will not normally be removed from CRAN: however, they may
be archived, including at the maintainer&rsquo;s request.

<p>Packages for which <code>R CMD check</code> gives an &lsquo;<samp>ERROR</samp>&rsquo; when a
new R <em>x.y.0</em> version is released will be archived (or in
exceptional circumstances updated by the CRAN team) unless the
maintainer has set a firm deadline for an upcoming update (and keeps to
it).
</p>
<p>Maintainers will be asked to update packages which show any warnings or
significant notes, especially at around the time of a new <em>x.y.0</em>
release.  Packages which are not updated are liable to be archived.
</p>
</li><li> Packages should be of the minimum necessary size.  Reasonable
compression should be used for data (not just <samp>.rda</samp> files) and PDF
documentation: CRAN will if necessary pass the latter through
<code>qpdf</code>.

<p>As a general rule, neither data nor documentation should exceed 5MB
(which covers several books).  A CRAN package is not an appropriate
way to distribute course notes, and authors will be asked to trim
their documentation to a maximum of 5MB.
</p>
<p>Where a large amount of data is required (even after compression),
consideration should be given to a separate data-only package which
can be updated only rarely (since older versions of packages are
archived in perpetuity).
</p>
<p>Similar considerations apply to other forms of &ldquo;data&rdquo;, e.g.,
<code>jar</code> files.
</p>
</li><li> Checking the package should take as little CPU time as possible, as the
CRAN check farm is a very limited resource and there are thousands of
packages.  Long-running tests and vignette code can be made optional for
checking, but do ensure that the checks that are left do exercise all
the features of the package.

<p>If running a package uses multiple threads/cores it must never use more
than two simultaneously: the check farm is a shared resource and will
typically be running many checks simultaneously.
</p>
<p>Examples should run for no more than a few seconds each: they are
intended to exemplify to the would-be user how to use the functions in
the package.
</p>

</li><li> The code and examples provided in a package should never do anything
which might be regarded as malicious or anti-social.  The following are
illustrative examples from past experience.

<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- Compiled code should never terminate the R process within which it is
running.  Thus C/C++ calls to <code>assert</code>/<code>abort</code>/<code>exit</code>,
Fortran calls to <code>STOP</code> and so on must be avoided.  Nor may R code
call <code>q()</code>.

</li><li>- A package must not tamper with the code already loaded into R: any
attempt to change code in the standard and recommended packages which
ship with R is prohibited.  Altering the namespace of another package
should only be done with the agreement of the maintainer of that
package.

</li><li>- Packages should not write in the users&rsquo; home filespace, nor anywhere
else on the file system apart from the R session&rsquo;s temporary directory
(or during installation in the location pointed to by <code>TMPDIR</code>: and
such usage should be cleaned up).  Installing into the system&rsquo;s R
installation (e.g., scripts to its <samp>bin</samp> directory) is not allowed.

<p>Limited exceptions may be allowed in interactive sessions if the
package obtains confirmation from the user.
</p>
</li><li>- Packages should not modify the global environment (user&rsquo;s workspace).

</li><li>- Packages should not start external software (such as PDF viewers or
browsers) during examples or tests unless that specific instance of
the software is explicitly closed afterwards.

</li><li>- Packages should not send information about the R session to the
maintainer&rsquo;s or third-party sites without obtaining confirmation from
the user.

</li><li>- Packages must not disable the stack-checking mechanism in the R process
into which they are loaded.

</li><li>- <acronym>CRAN</acronym> packages should use only the public API.  Hence they
should not use entry points not declared as API in installed headers nor
<code>.Internal()</code> nor <code>.Call()</code> etc calls to base packages. Also,
<code>:::</code> should not be used to access undocumented/internal functions
in base packages.  Such usages can cause packages to break at any time,
even in patched versions of R.

</li></ul>

</li><li> Changes to <acronym>CRAN</acronym> packages causing significant disruption to
other packages must be agreed with the <acronym>CRAN</acronym> maintainers well
in advance of any publicity.  Introduction of new packages providing
back-compatibility versions of already available packages is not
allowed.

</li></ul>

<hr>
<a name="Binary-packages"></a>
<a name="Binary-packages-1"></a>
<h2 class="unnumbered">Binary packages</h2>

<p>Policies for when a (Windows or OS X) binary package will be distributed:
</p>
<ul>
<li> all its package dependencies on CRAN are available for that platform.
Dependencies from other repositories will be installed at CRAN&rsquo;s
discretion.

</li><li> any external software needed can easily be installed on the build
machine for all the sub-architectures: here &ldquo;easily&rdquo; includes not
depending on specific versions, nor should the installed binary depend
on specific versions.

</li><li> it passes <code>R CMD check</code> without error for all the available
sub-architectures, or at CRAN&rsquo;s discretion, for the most important
sub-architecture(s).

</li></ul>

<p>Binary packages are not accepted from maintainers: CRAN will only host
binary packages prepared by those responsible for the binary areas.
Their packages are made automatically by batch jobs and can take a day
or two to appear on the CRAN master site (maybe longer to reach CRAN
mirrors).
</p>
<hr>
<a name="Submission"></a>
<a name="Submission-1"></a>
<h2 class="unnumbered">Submission</h2>

<p>When submitting a package to CRAN you should <strong>either</strong>
</p><ul>
<li> use the submission form at <a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/submit.html">http://CRAN.R-project.org/submit.html</a>
(and not send an email).  You will be sent a confirmation email which
needs to be accepted.

<p><strong>or</strong>
</p>
</li><li> upload by anonymous <code>ftp</code> to
<a href="ftp://CRAN.R-project.org/incoming/">ftp://CRAN.R-project.org/incoming/</a> and send a (plain text ASCII)
email at the same time, with subject line as specified below.

</li></ul>

<p>In either case, you can check that the submission was received by
looking at <a href="ftp://cran.r-project.org/incoming/">ftp://cran.r-project.org/incoming/</a>.
</p>
<p>In more detail:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Uploads must be source tarballs created by <code>R CMD build</code> and
following the <samp><var>PACKAGE</var>_<var>VERSION</var>.tar.gz</samp> naming scheme.

</li><li> Please ensure that <code>R CMD check --as-cran</code> has been run <em>on
the tarball to be uploaded</em> before submission.  This should be done with
the current version of R-devel (or if that is not possible, current
R-patched or the current release of R.) 

<p>In principle, packages must pass <code>R CMD check</code> without warnings or
significant notes to be admitted to the main <acronym>CRAN</acronym> package
area.  If there are warnings or notes you cannot eliminate (for example
because you believe them to be spurious) send an explanatory note as
part of your covering email, or as a comment on the submission form.
</p>
</li><li> For a package update, please check that any packages depending on this
one still pass <code>R CMD check</code>: it is especially expected that you
will have checked your own packages.  A listing of the reverse
dependencies of the current version can be found on the CRAN web page
for the package.

</li><li> An <code>ftp</code> upload should be accompanied by an email to
<a href="mailto:CRAN@R-project.org">CRAN@R-project.org</a> sent from the maintainer address listed in
the package, and using the subject line &lsquo;CRAN submission <var>PACKAGE</var>
<var>VERSION</var>&rsquo;, where <var>PACKAGE</var> and <var>VERSION</var> are the package
name and version, respectively.  Plain text ASCII emails should be used
if at all possible.

<p>If for some reason the submission has to be made by someone else (for
example, a co-author) this needs to be explained, and the designated
maintainer will need to confirm the submission.  Explain any change in
the maintainer&rsquo;s email address and if possible send confirmation from
the previous address.
</p>
<p>For a new submission, confirm in your email that you have read and agree
to these policies.  (This includes new versions of previously archived
packages, and the first submission as the new maintainer for a package.)
</p>
<p>If the package needs special treatment (for example if vignettes can
only be run or re-built on the maintainer&rsquo;s machine or take a very long
time), say so in the submission email or on the submission form.
</p>
<p>Do not email the package itself.
</p>
</li><li> Once uploaded, no further submissions of that package should be made
whilst the uploaded version is pending processing (which may take a
few days) and you have not received a reply from a CRAN maintainer.

</li><li> Part of the processing is that uploads may be renamed by adding one of
the extensions <samp>.save</samp>, <samp>.pending</samp> or <samp>.noemail</samp>:  the
presence of such a file is a sign that the submission process is not 
finished yet and CRAN maintainers are waiting for response or 
resubmission from the package maintainer (and such a file name should 
never be uploaded).

</li><li> Submitting updates should be done responsibly and with respect for the
volunteers&rsquo; time.  Once a package is established (which may take several
rounds), &ldquo;no more than every 1&ndash;2 months&rdquo; seems appropriate.

<p>Authors can avoid a lot of the all too frequent rounds of updates by
checking carefully for themselves.  It should be normal for those
without Windows machines of their own to use the
<a href="http://win-builder.R-project.org/">winbuilder</a> service to
check a package before submission.  There is a lot of helpful advice on
writing portable packages in <a href="../../doc/manuals/R-exts.html">&ldquo;Writing R Extensions&rdquo;</a>.
</p>
</li><li> If an update will change the package&rsquo;s API and hence affect packages
depending on it, it is expected that you will contact the maintainers of
affected packages and suggest changes, and give them time to prepare
updates before submitting your updated package.  Do mention in
the submission email which packages are affected and that their
maintainers have been informed.
In order to derive the reverse dependencies of a package including the 
addresses of maintainers who have to be notified upon changes, the 
function <a href="http://developer.r-project.org/CRAN/Scripts/depends.R">reverse_dependencies_with_maintainers</a> is available from the developer 
website.
